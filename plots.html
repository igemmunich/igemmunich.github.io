  To characterize key protein of our diagnostic device we conducted several experiments 



To find optimal concentrations for our diagnostic device we conducted several experiments characterizing our key protein. 

Firstly, we confirmed that Cas13a activity is target dependent. Despite the fact that Cas13a exhibits RNase activity in absence of target RNA, its activity in presence of target RNA is up to 8 times higher. However, this is true at low protein concentrations. At high concentrations of Cas13a presence of target RNA does not have significant effect on enzyme activity as depicted in the Figure 3.

Secondly, we verified that enzyme is activated by crRNA. As Figure 4 (this is the only figure with old enzyme, so concentrations are completely off the values of enzyme purified and used later on) shows, enzyme is active only in the presence of crRNA. It can be seen the higher is the concentration of crRNA, the more of enzyme gets activated, which is in accordance with the first step of reaction <link to overall reaction equation>. Besides that, crRNA when forming a complex with Cas13a defines specificity of ribonuclease. This was confirmed by cross-reactivity experiment.

And most importantly we determined detection limit of Cas13a-crRNA complex by varying target RNA concentration. Figure 2 shows that target concentrations above two-digits in nanomolar range can be detected.
